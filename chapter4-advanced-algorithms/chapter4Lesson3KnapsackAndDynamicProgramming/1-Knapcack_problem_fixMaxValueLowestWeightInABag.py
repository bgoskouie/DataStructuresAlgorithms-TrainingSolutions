# Knapsack Problem
# Now that you saw the dynamic programming solution for the knapsack problem,
# it's time to implement it. Assume you are given two things:

# The items, each having its associated weight (kg) and value ( $ ).
# A knapsack that can hold a maximum weight of knapsack_max_weight (kg).
# Use dynamic programming to implement the function knapsack_max_value()
# to return the maximum total value of items that can be accommodated into the given knapsack.

# Note - The items variable is the type Item, which is a named tuple.

# Helper code
import collections

# An item can be represented as a namedtuple
Item = collections.namedtuple('Item', ['weight', 'value'])

# The Naive Approach - Based on Recursion:
# The idea is, for each given item, if the item-weight is less than the
# remaining capacity (kg) of the knapsack, then calculate the value ( $ ) of the knapsack if we:

# Do not put the item in the knapsack - Value ( $ ) of the knapsack will be
# the output of the knapsack_recursive() function, with the same remaining
# capacity, and check for the next item down the list.
# Put the item in the knapsack - Value ( $ ) of the knapsack will be the sum
# of the current value of the item and output of the knapsack_recursive() function,
# with updated remaining capacity, and check for the next item down the list.
# Return the maximum of either of the above two values. In knapsack_recursive()
# function, begin with developing the solution for the base case i.e., smallest subproblem.

# Note - Below is the implementation of this naive approach with recursion, that
# has an exponential time complexity as  ùëÇ(2ùëõ) , where  ùëõ  is the number of given items,
# becuase we are evaluating both the two options (put/not put) for each given item.


# Naive Approach based on Recursion
def knapsack_max_value_2_pow_n(knapsack_max_weight, items):
    lastIndex = len(items) - 1
    return knapsack_recursive(knapsack_max_weight, items, lastIndex)


def knapsack_recursive(capacity, items, lastIndex):
    # Base case
    if (capacity <= 0) or (lastIndex < 0):
        return 0

    # Put the item in the knapsack
    valueA = 0
    if (items[lastIndex].weight <= capacity):
        valueA = items[lastIndex].value + knapsack_recursive(capacity - items[lastIndex].weight, items, lastIndex - 1)

    # Do not put the item in the knapsack
    valueB = knapsack_recursive(capacity, items, lastIndex - 1)

    # Pick the maximum of the two results
    result = max(valueA, valueB)

    return result

# 2nd solution:
# Dynamic Programming Approach
# Store and reuse the intermediate results in a lookup table. This step is called memoization.
# Start with initializing a lookup table (a list), where the index represents the remaining
# capacity (kg) of the knapsack, and the element represents the maximum value ( $ ) that it can hold.

# For a given item, if the item-weight is less than the remaining capacity (kg) of the knapsack, then we have two options:

# Do not pick the item - In this case, the value ( $ ) of knapsack with the remaining capacity would not change.
# It can be represented as lookup_table[capacity].
# Pick the item - In this case, the value ( $ ) and capacity (kg) of the knapsack would be updated.
# The value ( $ ) of the knapsack will be equal to value ( $ ) of the current object + value ( $ ) in the lookup
# table at [capacity - item.weight] position. It can be represented as lookup_table[capacity - item.weight] + item.value.
# Update the lookup table, lookup_table[capacity], with the maximum of either of the above two values.

# Note - This approach with dynamic programming will have a time complexity as  ùëÇ(2ùëõùê∂)‚â°ùëÇ(ùëõùê∂) ,
# where  ùëõ  is the number of given items and  ùê∂  is the max capacity (kg) of the knapsack.

# Exercise - Write the function definition here

# Babak's solution:
def knapsack_max_value(knapsack_max_weight, items):
    """
    Get the maximum value of the knapsack.
    """
    lookup_table = [0] * (knapsack_max_weight + 1)   # since weights increment by 1 by 1
    # lookup_iable[i] represents the value of weight "i"
    # At initialization: no item is considered yet and values for all possible weights is 0
    for item in items:
        # the remaining capacity (weight) that can fit in the knapsack
        knapsack_solver(lookup_table, item, knapsack_max_weight + 1)
    return lookup_table[knapsack_max_weight]


def knapsack_solver(lookup_table, item, max_weight):
    """This function assume that the lookup table has the best solution
    (maximum values) for the items that are already scanned.
    This item is currently under consideration if it should be added to Knapsack or not."""

    # Not picking up the item:
    for capacity in range(0, max_weight):
        if item.weight <= capacity:
            v1 = lookup_table[capacity]
            # value of the item we are trying to add plus
            v2 = item.value + lookup_table[capacity - item.weight]
            lookup_table[capacity] = max([v1, v2])

# DP Solution
# Get the maximum total value ($) of items that can be accommodated into the given knapsack
def knapsack_max_value(knapsack_max_weight, items):

    # Initialize a lookup table to store the maximum value ($)
    lookup_table = [0] * (knapsack_max_weight + 1)


    # Iterate down the given list
    for item in items:
        # The "capcacity" represents amount of remaining capacity (kg) of knapsack at a given moment. 
        for capacity in reversed(range(knapsack_max_weight + 1)):
            if item.weight <= capacity:
                lookup_table[capacity] = max(lookup_table[capacity], lookup_table[capacity - item.weight] + item.value)
