    # The reason is that, for manhatan distance (h) is not smaller than "all" possible paths, e.g. three nodes 
    # start: n1 (0,10), n2 (7,7), goal: n3 (10,0), are on the path and we want to go from n1 to n3.
    # The Euclidean distance from n1 to n3 is 14.14. The manhatan distance from n1 to n3 is 20, and the real
    # distance is the sum of the Euclideans of n1 to n2 and n2 to n3 which is 15,23.
    # clearly 15.23 < 20 and thus if we use Manhatan distance the problem won't return the right solution under some circumstances.
    # Manhatan distance would still be correct (and better than Euclidean distnance) to use if the grid map allowed motions are in 4 directions.
    # From:  http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html
    # On a grid, there are well-known heuristic functions to use.
    # Use the distance heuristic that matches the allowed movement:
    # On a square grid that allows 4 directions of movement, use Manhattan distance (L1).
    # On a square grid that allows 8 directions of movement, use Diagonal distance (Lâˆž).
    # On a square grid that allows any direction of movement, you might or might not want Euclidean distance (L2). If A* is finding paths on the grid but you are allowing movement not on the grid, you may want to consider other representations of the map.
    # On a hexagon grid that allows 6 directions of movement, use Manhattan distance adapted to hexagonal grids.

    # Diagonal distance
    # D = 1
    # D2 = math.sqrt(2)
    # return D*(dx + dy) + (D2 - 2*D)*min(dx, dy)
    # Assuming a rectangle from upper left corner n1 to lower left corner n3, (if dy < dx), the Diagonal distance would be composed of two line segments
    # one diaonal line with distance of D2*dy from n1 to the lower edge of the rectangle (say point n3), going horizontally in the amount of dy and the second segment would be a line (from n3 to n2) in the amount of dx-dy (all horizontal). This is a good metric (heuristic) if 8 directional motion is allowed only.
